I built **terraform-ai-examples**: AWS Terraform examples that include more than code snippets.

What makes it different:
- architecture diagrams
- system-design sizing math
- incident runbooks
- cost estimator tooling

If you want to learn practical infra patterns (not toy setups), this might help:

Built a repo for practical AWS Terraform learning:
- diagrams
- sizing math
- incident runbooks
- cost estimator

Not just snippets. Full examples.

Title: I rebuilt my Terraform examples repo to include system-design sizing + incident runbooks

Body:
I rebuilt this repo to be more useful than generic snippet generation.

It now includes:
- production-style AWS Terraform examples
- architecture diagrams per example
- system-design sizing sections
- incident runbooks for likely failure scenarios
- a simple cost estimator script

Feedback on what to improve next is welcome.

I built this as practical learning material for Terraform + cloud system design.
Each example has architecture, validation steps, sizing calculations, incident simulation, and cost guidance.
