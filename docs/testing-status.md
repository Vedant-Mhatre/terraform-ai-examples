# Testing Status

Live deployment verification is tracked in the root status file:

- [TESTING_STATUS.md](https://github.com/Vedant-Mhatre/terraform-ai-examples/blob/master/TESTING_STATUS.md)

## Summary

At this time, examples are statically validated (`terraform init -backend=false` + `terraform validate`) but not all are yet fully verified by the maintainer with end-to-end live AWS deployment.

Use this repository as strong learning/reference material, and validate in your own AWS account constraints before production use.
