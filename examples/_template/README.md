## Real-World Use Case

Describe where this pattern is used in production and why teams choose it.

## Usage

```bash
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Validation Steps

1. Step to verify resource behavior
2. Step to verify outputs
3. Step to verify expected failure handling

## System Design Sizing

- Assumption 1:
- Assumption 2:
- Capacity formula:
- Backlog/latency/storage formula:

## Incident Simulation

## Cost and Safety

- Expected cost range:
- Most expensive resource:
- Guardrail in this example:

## Cleanup

```bash
terraform destroy
```
